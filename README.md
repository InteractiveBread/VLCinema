# VLCinema

This is just a little GUI to start a Console VLC with HTTP interface.
The HTTP interface allows you to control the video stream with another device via browser.
You could run VLCinema on a Raspberry Pi (or any other capable computer) while controlling the stream with a phone, laptop or tablet within the same network.
